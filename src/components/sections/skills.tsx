        <p className='lead first-line:uppercase first-line:font-bold'>Iâ€™ve been making things since I was a teenager, drawing comic books and selling them to my classmates. I was sure I was going to work in the comics industry. But while studying cartooning at art school, I discovered Photoshop (version four!), and something just clicked. I fell in love with graphic design and shifted gears. Suddenly, I was working with specialty inks, embossing techniques, and interesting folds in print â€” basically, finding every creative edge I could in physical media. But not long after, the web caught my eye.</p>
