  **In a pioneering project during a transformative period, the NYU School of
  Global Public Health (GPH) embarked on a mission to revolutionize its digital
  footprint.** This venture was a website redesign and a comprehensive
  reimagination of how their ethos and dynamism could be encapsulated and
  communicated online. The result was a digital platform showcasing the school's
  vibrant energy and multi-disciplinary approach, significantly enhancing the
  user experience.

## The Client

NYU GPH sought to consolidate over 40 years of public health education into a singular vision. They aim to advance health equity and inspire action across disciplinary and geographic boundaries. The challenge was to create a web presence that reflected GPH's forward-thinking and diverse ethos rooted in the heart of New York City.

## The Challenge

GPH aimed to establish a digital identity mirroring its innovative spirit and commitment to public health. The primary objectives were to enhance site functionality and visual impact within a fixed budget, leveraging existing technical resources and adopting a clean-sheet design approach for a fresh, engaging user experience.

## The Solution

The project team, led by my keen focus on content and marketing, dove deep into the college's core values and aspirations. Through extensive collaboration and a month-long exploration of mood boards, a design strategy emerged that was as ambitious as it was meticulous. The website was rebuilt to emphasize GPH's dynamic nature, with a focus on:

- **Component-Driven Design**: This approach enabled GPH to maintain a versatile yet unified system for content creation, ensuring a consistent and compelling online experience.
- **Bold Visual Language**: The commitment to a "big and bold" aesthetic was realized through striking imagery and typography, setting GPH apart from its peers.

- **Engaging Content Strategy**: Leveraging their substantial collection of photography and ongoing content creation, GPH's digital presence was enriched with stories of student successes, live video events, and podcasts that resonated with prospective students and faculty alike.

## The Impact

The redesign project marked a significant milestone for GPH, transforming its web presence into a beacon of inspiration and engagement. The new site reflects the college's unique character and mission and has played a pivotal role in its growth and success. As Chris Alexander, a key figure in the project, noted, the school's engaging content strategy has been instrumental in attracting students, with many citing the school's podcast as a deciding factor in their choice to attend GPH.

## Conclusion

The NYU GPH website redesign is a testament to the power of visionary leadership, bold design, and strategic content. It showcases how a commitment to innovation and a deep understanding of one's audience can lead to extraordinary outcomes. The project met its initial goals and paved the way for GPH's continued success and influence in public health education.
